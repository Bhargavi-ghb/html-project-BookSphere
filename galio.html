        Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was a renowned Italian astronomer, physicist, and mathematician often called the father of modern science. He made revolutionary contributions through his books and observations. In Sidereus Nuncius (1610), Galileo revealed discoveries made using a telescope, such as Jupiter’s moons, lunar mountains, and the phases of Venus—providing strong support for the heliocentric theory that the Sun is at the center of the solar system. His famous work Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632) compared the Earth-centered and Sun-centered models, firmly backing the ideas of Copernicus. This led to conflict with the Church, resulting in his house arrest. While confined, Galileo wrote Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638), where he explored the laws of motion, gravity, and strength of materials, laying the groundwork for classical physics. His core theories—such as the law of inertia, uniform acceleration, and emphasis on the scientific method—transformed science and paved the way for future discoveries.
